--- Original Description ---
A mod that allows pawns to educate each other.

Description
A mod that allows pawns to educate each other. The higher the passion for the subject, the higher the odds of discussion and the more experience is shared.
When the teacher has skill level 20, something special may happen... :)

Savegame compatible.

Should not conflict with any mods

I did not spend a ton of time testing the balance (activation odds, exp gain). Please let me know your opinions on the balance of activation odds and exp gain, or if you notice any spelling errors in the log.

This mod has one of my other mods built in (Empty Play Log) in order to allow uninstalling. If you are subscribed to this one, you don't need Empty Play Log. Subscribing to both will cause the button to show up twice, but shouldn't cause any other problems.

Functionality Specifics

Configuration
Upon loading the mod the first time, a file should get generated at C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config\PawnEducation.config . The values in this file can be edited/saved to change the parameters of the interaction algorithms. Setting values too high might cause errors. Some values are explicitly capped due to game engine limitations.

To edit opinion/mood gains from interactions, modify the Def files at :
{STEAM_INSTALL_LOCATION}\steamapps\workshop\content\294100\1729795429\Defs

Where {STEAM_INSTALL_LOCATION} is the location of the Steam partition containing RimWorld


Uninstalling
1. Load your existing save
2. Put the game into 'pause' mode
3. Click the debug action 'Clear Play Log' under 'Mods - Misc'
4. Make a new save
5. Exit to menu
6. Disable/unsubcribe from Pawn Education
7. Load new save (ignore warnings)

Dependencies
None
