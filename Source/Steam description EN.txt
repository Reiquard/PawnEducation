A mod that allows pawns to educate each other. 

[h1]Description[/h1]
A mod that allows pawns to educate each other. The higher the passion for the subject, the higher the odds of discussion and the more experience is shared.
When the teacher has skill level 20, something special may happen... :)

Should not conflict with any mods, except possibly others that make edits to the Inspect pane.
